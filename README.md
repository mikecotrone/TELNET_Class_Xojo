I wrote this TELNET class to properly negotiate TELNET IAC options and IAC sub-options with my remote hosts in order to properly and efficiently retreive information. This Xojo project is free to use
and has no disclaimers or warranties. Use at your own risk and please email me with any suggestions.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:

I didn't implement all of the TELNET options primarly due to the age of this protocol. We do not live in the world of IBM hosts or TN3270 emulation any longer, bandwidth is plentiful, and half duplex communication is dead :)

The Basic Terminal front end that is a part of this Demo is for example purposes only since it is limited.
